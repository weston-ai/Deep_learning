#### PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY:
# This project developed a deep feed-forward binary classifier in PyTorch to predict whether a patient (simulated patient) developed hypertension within a 24-month observation window. Our objective was to permute the network architecture across different combinations of layer depth, layer capacity, batch size, and dropout percentage, to identify the optimal performing architecture (according to ROC AUC and PR AUC). The total dataset contained 60,000 simulated human patients that were matched with appropriate individual and community confounding variables. The pre-training split used class-stratified sampling to assign 37,500 patients to the training dataset; 11,250 patients to the validation dataset; and 11,250 patients to the testing dataset. Each input vector was cross-sectional, with no temporal sequence. All data underwent a preprocessing pipeline using internal and external python modules. The neural net was then trained on a validation dataset, and the best performant training model was tested on a holdout test dataset. Those testing results were contrasted with the performance of a logistic regression model that was trained and tested with the same training and holdout test datasets. All results were summarized via HTML and saved to PDF.
